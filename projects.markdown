    <strong>ROS | MoveIt! | LLM | PyQT </strong> <br><br>
    We introduce a novel integrated development system, <strong>Alchemist</strong>, that leverages LLMs to empower end-users in creating, testing, and running robot programs using natural language inputs, aiming to reduce the required knowledge for developing robot applications.

    <strong>ROS | Simulink | C++ | SLAM | Motion planning</strong> <br><br>
    In this project, we developed an intelligent vehicle which can carry the tea harvesting tool and walk side-by-side with a farmer to pluck the tea collaboratively.
    In addition to the collaborative features, object avoidance and path planning had been implemented to perform autonomous turning between rows of tea trees.

    <strong>3D printing | Solidworks | Mechanism design </strong> <br><br>
    This project aims to develop an intelligent sensing and precise cultivating system for tomato growth in greenhouses by integrating Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging with a robotic arm. I designed and 3d printed a 5 DoF robotic arm and use it for visual-servoing to accomplish this.
